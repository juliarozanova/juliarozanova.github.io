I am a final year Computer Science PhD Student at the University of Manchester, supervised by [Andre Freitas](http://andrefreitas.org) and [Uli Sattler](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/).
Having previously finished an [MSc in mathemtics](http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/105807), I am now working at the intersection of language, logic and computation. My core areas of focus are:
- Natural Language Inference
- Natural Logic
- Interpretability of Neural Models
- Computational Semantics
- Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning
- Testing and Verification of Neural NLP Models

I also am currently working with the [Enncore project](https://enncore.github.io/) led by Lucas Cordeiro and Andre Freitas.
