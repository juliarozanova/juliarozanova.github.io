I am a recent Computer Science PhD graduate, and currently an Applied Science intern at the Amazon Alexa knowledge group in Cambridge, UK.

During my PhD at the University of Machester, I was supervised by [Andre Freitas](http://andrefreitas.org) and [Uli Sattler](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/). 
Before that, I did an MSc in mathematics at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa, supervised by [Ingrid Rewitzky](https://math.sun.ac.za/irew/).
<!-- I am part of the *Reasoning and Explainable AI* lab ([ExplAIn Lab](https://ai-systems-lab.org/)). -->

My core interest is Natural Language Processing, but more specifically:
- **NLU** (Natural Language Understanding), including models for natural language inference, reasoning and interaction with knowledge bases.
- **Interpretability** of neural NLP models, including topics such probing and representation-level interventions.

### Name Confusion?
My Russian name "Юлия" has been translated differently on various legal documents: 
I'm "Yulia Rozanova" on my Russian passport, 
and "Julia Rozanova" on my South African identity documents.
I have used "Julia" all my life, but suddenly had to start using "Yulia" legally when I came to the UK in 2019. Weird!
Call me Julia. :)
