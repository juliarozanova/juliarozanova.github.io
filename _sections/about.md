I am a final year Computer Science PhD Student at the [University of Manchester](), supervised by [Andre Freitas](http://andrefreitas.org) and [Uli Sattler]().
Having previously finished an [MSc in mathemtics](), I am now working at the intersection of language, logic and computation. My core areas of focus are:
- Natural Language Inference
- Natural Logic
- Interpretability of Neural Models
- Computational Semantics
- Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning
- Testing and Verification of Neural NLP Models

I am currently working with the [Enncore project]() led by Lucas Cordeiro and Andre Freitas.
